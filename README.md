# Conceptual Quantum Sorting Algorithm (Qiskit)

This repository contains a Qiskit Python script that outlines a **conceptual** quantum algorithm for sorting a list of numbers. The primary goal is to demonstrate how quantum principles could theoretically achieve a computational speedup, potentially reaching an `O(polylog N)` time complexity for the sorting process itself, which is a significant improvement over classical `O(N log N)` algorithms.

**Important Note:** This is a theoretical exploration and not a ready-to-use practical implementation for current quantum hardware. It uses "black box" conceptual functions for complex quantum operations that are currently subjects of active research.

## Project Overview

The script simulates a quantum sorting process by breaking it down into four conceptual phases:

1.  **QRAM-like Data Loading (Phase 1):** Preparing an initial superposition of `|index>|value>` pairs, simulating data retrieval from a Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM).
2.  **Global Rank Determination (Phase 2):** Conceptually calculating the rank (position in the sorted list) for each element in superposition using principles similar to Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) and quantum comparators. This phase is the core of the potential `O(polylog N)` speedup.
3.  **Quantum Permutation by Rank (Phase 3):** Reorganizing the superposed data based on their calculated ranks, effectively moving values to their sorted positions using a conceptual quantum permutation network.
4.  **Measurement (Phase 4):** Measuring the final quantum registers to obtain the classical sorted list. While the quantum computation might be `O(polylog N)`, the classical readout remains `O(N)`.

## Key Quantum Concepts Demonstrated

*   **Superposition:** All data elements are processed simultaneously.
*   **Entanglement:** Implicitly used for coherent operations across registers.
*   **Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE):** Conceptually applied for rank calculation.
*   **Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM):** Assumed for fast data loading.
*   **Quantum Comparators:** Essential building blocks for rank calculation.
*   **Quantum Permutation Networks:** For reordering data based on calculated ranks.

## Qubit Requirements

The script calculates and prints the number of qubits required for a given `N_ELEMENTS` and `MAX_VALUE`. For the default `N_ELEMENTS = 4` and `MAX_VALUE = 7`:

*   `n_idx` (Original Index): 2 qubits
*   `n_val` (Value): 3 qubits
*   `n_rank` (Calculated Rank): 2 qubits
*   `n_temp_val` (Temporary Value): 3 qubits
*   `n_ancilla_comp` (Ancilla for Comparison): 1 qubit
*   `n_ancilla_qpe` (Ancilla for QPE): 4 qubits
*   `n_total_sorted_val_qubits` (Output Sorted Values): 12 qubits (4 elements * 3 qubits/element)

**Total Logical Qubits (for N=4, MAX_VALUE=7): 27 qubits** (excluding physical qubit overhead for error correction, etc.)

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need Python and the following libraries:

*   Qiskit
*   NumPy
*   Matplotlib (for plotting histograms)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
    (Replace `your-username/your-repo-name` with the actual path to your repository)

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install qiskit numpy matplotlib
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Save the provided script** as a Python file (e.g., `quantum_sort_conceptual.py`).
2.  **Run the script from your terminal:**
    ```bash
    python quantum_sort_conceptual.py
    ```

## Expected Output & Caveats

When you run the script, you will see:

*   Information about the number of qubits needed for each register.
*   Print statements outlining each conceptual phase of the algorithm.
*   A simulated execution of **Phase 1 (QRAM-like data loading)**.
*   A `qiskit.visualization.plot_histogram` output showing the statevector probabilities after Phase 1. This plot will correctly reflect the initial superposition of `|index>|value>` pairs (`|00>|101>`, `|01>|010>`, `|10>|111>`, `|11>|000>` for input `[5, 2, 7, 0]`).

**CRITICAL CAVEAT:**
The script **will NOT produce a sorted output** from the full quantum circuit simulation. This is because:
*   The functions `U_global_rank_oracle_concept` and `U_permute_by_rank_concept` are **placeholders (`pass` statements)**. They represent incredibly complex quantum circuits that are not yet fully implemented with elementary Qiskit gates in this script.
*   Simulating these complex operations efficiently and generically is beyond the scope of this conceptual demonstration and would require sophisticated quantum circuit synthesis.

The output will primarily serve to show the initial data loading and the conceptual flow of the algorithm.

## Theoretical Considerations & Limitations

*   **Conceptual "Black Boxes":** The core challenge lies in building the actual quantum circuits for `U_global_rank_oracle_concept` (coherent rank calculation) and `U_permute_by_rank_concept` (arbitrary quantum permutation). These would involve highly non-trivial quantum arithmetic and control.
*   **QRAM Reality:** Ideal QRAM, which allows loading data in `O(log N)` time, is itself a theoretical construct. Practical QRAM implementations are a major research area.
*   **Hardware Requirements:** This algorithm, even if fully implemented, would require a fault-tolerant quantum computer with a very large number of stable qubits and long coherence times, far beyond current NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices.
*   **Classical Readout:** While the *computation* phase aims for `O(polylog N)`, the final step of measuring and extracting all `N` sorted elements remains an `O(N)` classical operation. The quantum speedup is in the *process* of ordering the data, not in the final classical readout time.
*   **Generalizability:** While the `N=4` example is simple, scaling these conceptual operations to large `N` requires generic, efficient quantum circuit designs.

This project is a representation of how quantum computing *could* revolutionize algorithms, pushing the boundaries of what's computationally feasible, but it highlights the immense research and engineering challenges that remain.
